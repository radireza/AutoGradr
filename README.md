# AutoGradr
This program was created at a short high school Hackathon.  It has the ability to quickly grade Java CS labs through a virtual environment.

## Getting Started

This program only works on Windows (tested on XP, Vista, 7, 8.1, and 10)

## Requirements
* javac in command line
* Java 8 and above
* A program that can open spreadsheets

### Using the Binaries
Just extract the folder and run AutoGradr.jar.

### Compiling From Source
Retrieve the source from the project.  Compile the .java files and the .bat files (use Bat to Exe compiler) and create a folder called env in the compile location.
Make sure to include the commons io, commons cli, and POI libraries (all from Apache). 

## Usage
Remember to leave all student files as .java (Expected output does not need to be in .java).
Make sure the tester class follows the format className + Tester.
Also, please make sure the students only leave the first line with their name (in comments).
Lastly, remember to comment the classname (for the classes getting tested) in the first line of the tester.
Please note that this program ignores the difference betwee print and println.
Specify the directory to save the results.
